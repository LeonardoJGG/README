***1.Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages***

**•Compiled language**  

A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are usually "translators" that create machine code from source code written by the developer.

**•Interpreted language**

An interpreted language is a programming language in which instructions are mostly executed directly without first being compiled into machine language.

**Personal comparison**

In short, a compiled language when translated into machine language is more efficient for the user when executed, while an interpreted language is more optimized on the developer's side and is a little less efficient when executed since it means a slightly higher load for the machine.


***2.Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?***

Java is a language that is compiled and interpreted at the same time, since the compiler converts the code into bytecode, and then the Ja Virtual Machine ends up interpreting that code.
